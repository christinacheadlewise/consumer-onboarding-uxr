# Why Don't New Customers Complete Their First Transaction?

**Consumer Onboarding Drop-off Survey 2025**

> Survey of 1,331 new Wise customers (US, UK, Philippines) who registered in October 2025.
> Data collected: 22 October – 25 November 2025.
> Enriched with lifetime revenue and onboarding flow data from Snowflake.

## The 7 things you should know

### 1. Most "drop-offs" aren't actually lost

We surveyed customers ~30 days after registration. 147 said they hadn't completed their intended task. But when we checked the behavioural data, **81% of them had already adopted a Wise product *before* they took the survey** — a median of 61 days earlier. They'd used Wise for a different product than they originally intended (e.g., came to send money but activated via MCA/card).

**What this means for the product:** The onboarding flow is successfully getting people to activate (90% adopt something), but it's not always connecting them to the specific job they came for. 92% activate via MCA — even customers who came to send, receive, or invest. These customers are "active" by our internal metrics but report their original need as unmet. The opportunity isn't to increase adoption — it's to shorten the path from registration to the customer's *stated* job, not just any job.

### 2. The people who hesitate the most are your best customers

Customers who said "yes, something caused me to hesitate" have **double the lifetime revenue** (£50 median) when the hesitation was about trust/legitimacy. They're careful evaluators who commit deeply once satisfied. Don't optimise hesitation out of the journey — address the specific concern (trust signals, transparent pricing) and let them proceed at their pace.

### 3. Signup friction doesn't block people — it makes them less valuable long-term

86% of customers who reported difficulty still adopted. But their lifetime revenue is **30% lower** (£19 vs £28). The friction sets a negative first impression that persists in engagement patterns. Smoothing the experience won't dramatically change conversion rates, but it will increase how much each customer uses Wise over time.

### 4. Tell send/receive users about the card

21% of customers who came to send or receive money don't know Wise offers a card. Those unaware customers generate half the revenue (£17 vs £35) of those who ordered one. They also adopt slower. This is the most directly actionable finding in the survey.

### 5. Invest/Assets has a product-market fit problem at onboarding

47% of customers who came to invest dropped off — vs 8-10% for card/send/receive. This isn't an onboarding UX issue. The product either doesn't meet expectations set before signup, or there's a gap between "I want to invest" and "I can invest with Wise."

### 6. Speed perception matters more than speed reality

Customers who hesitated because they expected Wise to be slow have the **lowest lifetime value** (£9 median) and take the longest to adopt (8 days). Their initial framing of "this will be slow" seems to stick. Customers who hesitated about trust but were reassured became the highest-value segment. First impressions about speed seem harder to reverse than first impressions about trust.

### 7. Recent movers are your highest-value new customers

Customers who moved country in the last 6 months generate £42 median revenue — 60% more than the overall median. Their needs are acute and immediate. If you can identify them during onboarding, they're worth fast-tracking.

## Context

This survey was part of a broader initiative to understand why ~69% of new consumer customers don't convert within 30 days of registration. We reached customers across US, UK, and Philippines (English-language only) with a prize-draw incentive. The survey ran for approximately one month.
